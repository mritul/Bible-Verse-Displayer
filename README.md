# Bible Verse Displayer

This project began as a passion project as a tool Churches could use to display scripture verses on the fly.  Most current scripture display software requires the scriptures to be found prior to a service.  However, I haven't had the time to work on this so I'm opening it up for the open-source community to help on it.  

This repo should be especially valuable to Hacktoberfest coders as it has a simple tech stack and simple (for now) featureset.

**Tech stack**
- electronjs is the engine (Javascript)
- CSS styling is made easier with TailwindCSS classes


**Getting started**
1. Clone the repo
2. run ```npm install``` to initialize the node_modules
3. Begin coding!
